              <h1>RENT-A-ROOM SCHEME</h1>
              <p>
                Renting out a room in your home can be a great way of earning
                some additional income by utilising spare space in your
                property. In Ireland, where the lack of rental properties
                available has led to a huge increase in rent prices, rent-a-room
                can be an attractive option.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Rent-a-Room Relief scheme is designed to encourage people
                with spare rooms to rent them out, in the hopes that this may be
                one form of solution to the housing crisis. This scheme allows
                homeowners to earn up to â‚¬14,000 in a single tax year, exempt
                from income tax, PRSI, and USI.
